## 📋 Your To-Do List

### Step 1: Set Up MongoDB (REQUIRED - 10 minutes)

**Option A: Local MongoDB (Recommended for Development)**
```bash
# Install MongoDB
brew install mongodb-community@7.0

# Start MongoDB service
brew services start mongodb-community@7.0

# Verify it's running
brew services list | grep mongodb
```

**Option B: MongoDB Atlas (Recommended for Production)**
1. Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com
2. Create a free account
3. Create a new cluster (free tier M0)
4. Create a database user
5. Whitelist your IP address (or use 0.0.0.0/0 for development)
6. Get connection string (looks like: `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/big2`)
7. Update `.env` file with your connection string:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/big2
   ```

### Step 2: Test the Backend (5 minutes)

```bash
# Start the server
npm run dev
```

Expected output:
```
🚀 Server running in development mode on port 3001
✅ MongoDB Connected
```

**Test in another terminal:**
```bash
# Create a guest account
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/guest

# You should get a response with a token
```

If you see the server running and MongoDB connected - you're ready to go! ✅

### Step 3: Build the React Frontend (1-2 days)

**What You Need to Build:**

#### 3.1 Authentication Pages
- [ ] Login page (username/password form)
- [ ] Registration page (username/email/password form)
- [ ] Guest login button

**Reference:** See `CLIENT_SETUP.md` for code examples

#### 3.2 Game Lobby
- [ ] List of active games
- [ ] "Create Game" button
- [ ] "Join Game" with room code input
- [ ] Player count display

#### 3.3 Game Board Interface
- [ ] Card display (use images/CSS from big2.html)
- [ ] Player hands (yours visible, others hidden)
- [ ] Play area showing last played cards
- [ ] "Play" and "Pass" buttons
- [ ] Score display
- [ ] Chat box
- [ ] Turn indicator

#### 3.4 Additional UI
- [ ] Leaderboard page
- [ ] User profile page
- [ ] Game history page

**Quick Start Template:**
The `CLIENT_SETUP.md` file contains a complete template to get started quickly.

### Step 4: Connect Frontend to Backend (2-3 hours)

**What to implement:**

1. **API Service** (see CLIENT_SETUP.md)
   - [ ] Axios configuration with interceptors
   - [ ] Auth API calls (login, register, guest)
   - [ ] Game API calls (create, list, join)
   - [ ] User API calls (profile, leaderboard)

2. **Socket.IO Service** (see CLIENT_SETUP.md)
   - [ ] Connection management
   - [ ] Event listeners (game_joined, game_started, move_made, etc.)
   - [ ] Event emitters (join_game, start_game, player_move, player_pass)

3. **React Context**
   - [ ] Auth context for user state
   - [ ] Game context for game state

### Step 5: Test Multiplayer (1 hour)

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Create an account
- [ ] Create a game
- [ ] Open another browser tab in incognito mode
- [ ] Create a second account
- [ ] Join the game using room code
- [ ] Creator starts the game
- [ ] AI players are added
- [ ] Play cards and verify both players see updates
- [ ] Test passing
- [ ] Test chat
- [ ] Test disconnection/reconnection
- [ ] Complete a full game
- [ ] Check leaderboard updates

### Step 6: Deploy to Production (1 hour)

#### 6.1 Set Up GitHub Repository
```bash
# Stage all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Full-stack Big Two multiplayer game"

# Create repository on GitHub (github.com/new)

# Add remote and push
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/big2-multiplayer.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

#### 6.2 Deploy on Render

**Backend Deployment:**
1. Go to https://render.com
2. Sign up/Login with GitHub
3. Click "New +" → "Web Service"
4. Connect your GitHub repository
5. Render will detect `render.yaml` automatically
6. Add environment variables:
   - `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB Atlas connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET` - Will be auto-generated
   - `CLIENT_URL` - Will be your frontend URL
7. Click "Create Web Service"

**Frontend Deployment (Option 1: Netlify/Vercel):**
```bash
cd client
npm run build

# Deploy the 'build' folder to Netlify or Vercel
```

**Frontend Deployment (Option 2: Same as Backend):**
Update `server/index.js` to serve the React build folder in production.

#### 6.3 Update Environment Variables
After deploying frontend, update `CLIENT_URL` in Render to your frontend URL.

### Step 7: Final Polish (Optional)

- [ ] Add loading spinners
- [ ] Add error messages
- [ ] Add sound effects (from big2.html)
- [ ] Add animations
- [ ] Mobile responsive design
- [ ] Add game rules page
- [ ] Add tutorial/onboarding
- [ ] Add "Report Bug" button

## 🆘 Common Issues & Solutions

### Server Won't Start
**Problem:** `MongooseServerSelectionError`
**Solution:** Make sure MongoDB is running (`brew services list`)

### Can't Connect to Backend from Frontend
**Problem:** CORS errors in browser console
**Solution:** Check `CLIENT_URL` in `.env` matches your frontend URL

### Socket.IO Not Connecting
**Problem:** "WebSocket connection failed"
**Solution:** 
1. Check server is running
2. Verify Socket.IO client version matches server
3. Check CORS configuration

### Cards Not Displaying
**Problem:** Images not loading
**Solution:** Copy card images from `big2.html` to `client/public/images/`

### AI Players Not Working
**Problem:** AI doesn't make moves
**Solution:** Backend handles this automatically - check server logs for errors

## 🎮 Quick Win Strategy

**Want to see something working fast? Follow this minimal path:**

1. **Set up MongoDB** (10 min)
2. **Start backend** (`npm run dev`)
3. **Create minimal React UI** (2 hours):
   - Login form that calls `/api/auth/login`
   - Button to create game
   - Display room code
   - Join game button with room code input
4. **Test with Socket.IO** directly in browser console:
   ```javascript
   const socket = io('http://localhost:3001');
   socket.emit('join_game', { roomCode: 'ABC123' });
   socket.on('game_joined', (data) => console.log(data));
   ```

This gets you to a "working prototype" state quickly!

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Simple:** Get login → create game → join game working first
2. **Use Browser DevTools:** Check Network tab for API calls, Console for Socket.IO events
3. **Test with AI:** You can test alone - AI will fill empty slots
4. **Copy HTML/CSS:** The original `big2.html` has all the styling you need
5. **Read the Guides:** All the code you need is in `CLIENT_SETUP.md`

## ✨ You're Almost There!

The hard part (backend) is done. The frontend is mostly connecting pieces together. You've got this! 🚀

**When you get stuck:**
1. Check the documentation files
2. Read the code comments in the server files
3. Console.log everything
4. Test the API with curl/Postman first
5. Use browser DevTools to debug Socket.IO

**Need help?** All the patterns and examples are in `CLIENT_SETUP.md`.
